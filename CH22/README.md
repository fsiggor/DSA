# 87. Missing Number

**Difficulty:** Easy

**Category:** Bit Manipulation / Math

## Description

Given an array `nums` containing `n` distinct numbers in the range `[0, n]`, return the only number in the range that is missing from the array.

## Examples

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [3,0,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: n = 3 since there are 3 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,3]. 2 is the missing number.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [0,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: n = 2 since there are 2 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,2]. 2 is the missing number.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = [9,6,4,2,3,5,7,0,1]
Output: 8
```

## Constraints

- `n == nums.length`
- `1 <= n <= 10^4`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= n`
- All the numbers of `nums` are unique

## Hint

Use the formula for the sum of `0` to `n`: `n * (n + 1) / 2`. Subtract the actual sum of the array to find the missing number. Alternatively, use XOR: XOR all indices `0..=n` with all array values; the result is the missing number.
