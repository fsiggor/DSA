# 77. N-Queens

**Difficulty:** Hard

**Category:** Backtracking

## Description

The n-queens puzzle is the problem of placing `n` queens on an `n x n` chessboard such that no two queens attack each other.

Given an integer `n`, return all distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle. You may return the answer in any order.

Each solution contains a distinct board configuration of the n-queens' placement, where `'Q'` and `'.'` both indicate a queen and an empty space, respectively.

## Examples

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 4
Output: [[".Q..","...Q","Q...","..Q."],["..Q.","Q...","...Q",".Q.."]]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 1
Output: [["Q"]]
```

## Constraints

- `1 <= n <= 9`

## Hint

Use backtracking, placing one queen per row. Track which columns and diagonals are under attack. A queen on `(r, c)` attacks diagonal `r - c` and anti-diagonal `r + c`. Use sets to efficiently check if a placement is safe.
