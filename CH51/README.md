# House Robber

## Difficulty: Medium

## Description

You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed. The only constraint stopping you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security systems connected -- it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses are broken into on the same night.

Given an integer array `nums` representing the amount of money of each house, return the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police.

## Examples

**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums = [1, 2, 3, 1]
Output: 4
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3). Total = 1 + 3 = 4.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums = [2, 7, 9, 3, 1]
Output: 12
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 2), house 3 (money = 9) and house 5 (money = 1). Total = 2 + 9 + 1 = 12.
```

## Constraints

- `1 <= nums.len() <= 100`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 400`

## Hint

Use dynamic programming. At each house, decide whether to rob it (add its value to the best from two houses back) or skip it (take the best from the previous house).
